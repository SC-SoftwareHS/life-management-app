## 🔍 What's Currently Working vs Coming Soon

### ✅ **Fully Functional Now**
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ User login/logout
- ✅ Dashboard display
- ✅ 8 life areas visible
- ✅ Navigation between areas
- ✅ All API endpoints (accessible via `/docs`)

### 🚧 **Feature UIs Coming Soon**
The backend is 100% ready, but these frontend interfaces show "Coming Soon" placeholders:
- Goals management (add/edit/delete goals)
- Habits tracker (check-in, track streaks)
- Tasks kanban board (todo/doing/done)
- Contacts list (with birthday calculations)
- References library
- Health catalog
- Financial accounts
- Journal entries
- Conflict resolution topics

**You can still use these features via the API!** Go to https://web-production-e6a8.up.railway.app/docs to test all endpoints.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
- Check you're using the correct username/password
- Username and password are case-sensitive
- Try the demo account: `demouser` / `Demo1234`

### Page won't load
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
- Clear browser cache if needed

### "Cannot connect to server" error
- Railway might be cold-starting (first request after inactivity takes ~10 seconds)
- Wait a moment and try again
- Check if the API is up: https://web-production-e6a8.up.railway.app/health

### Already registered but forgot password
- Unfortunately, password reset isn't implemented yet
- Create a new account with a different username
- Or contact admin to reset the demo account

---

## 🎯 What to Try After Login

1. **Click on each life area card** to explore
2. **Try the logout button** (top right)
3. **Create goals via API** at `/docs` (until UI is ready)
4. **Test habits check-in** via API
5. **Add contacts** via API
6. **Explore Swagger docs** to see all available features

## 👥 Sharing with Others

To let your neighbor or others try the app:

1. **Share the URL:** https://web-production-e6a8.up.railway.app/static/index.html

2. **They can either:**
   - Use the demo account (`demouser` / `Demo1234`)
   - Register their own account

3. **Note:** Each user has their own isolated data. Demo account data is shared by everyone using it.

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (secure)
- ✅ Session-based authentication (HTTP-only cookies)
- ✅ HTTPS enabled by default on Railway
- ⚠️ Demo account is public - don't store real personal data there
- ⚠️ Database is ephemeral (resets on Railway redeploys)

## 📱 Mobile/Tablet Access

The app is **responsive** and works on mobile devices:
- Use the same URL on your phone/tablet
- Login works the same way
- Dashboard adapts to smaller screens

---

## 🆘 Still Can't Login?

If you're still having trouble:

1. **Check the browser console:**
   - Right-click → Inspect → Console tab
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Share them for debugging

2. **Test the API directly:**
   - Go to https://web-production-e6a8.up.railway.app/docs
   - Try the `/api/auth/login` endpoint manually
   - See if authentication works via API

3. **Check Railway logs:**
   - Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments → View Logs
   - Look for authentication errors

4. **Try a different browser:**
   - Sometimes cookie issues are browser-specific
   - Try Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
