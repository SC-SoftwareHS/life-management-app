## üéØ General Implementation Prompt

```
I have a life management application project with complete documentation. The project has:

- Complete PRD in docs/PRD.md
- Full data model specifications in docs/Data-Model.md
- Complete API schema in docs/API-Schema.md
- Architecture documentation in docs/Architecture.md
- Seed data in seed/fixtures.json

I need to implement the FastAPI backend. The tech stack is:
- FastAPI with SQLModel
- SQLite database
- Bcrypt authentication
- Alembic migrations

Please help me implement [SPECIFIC COMPONENT] following the specifications in the documentation.
```

---

## üì¶ Specific Component Prompts

### 1. Database Setup

```
Using the data model specifications in docs/Data-Model.md, please create:

1. server/app/db.py - Database engine and session management with SQLite
2. server/app/models.py - All SQLModel table models including:
   - User, LifeArea, Goal, GoalAreaLink
   - Habit, HabitAreaLink, HabitCheckin
   - Task, Contact, ContactAreaLink
   - Reference, ReferenceAreaLink, Entry
   - HealthCatalogItem, FinancialAccount, ConflictTopic

Include proper type hints, relationships, and the enums defined in the spec.
```

### 2. Pydantic Schemas

```
Using docs/API-Schema.md and docs/Data-Model.md, create server/app/schemas.py with:

1. Request schemas (Create, Update) for all models
2. Response schemas with nested relationships
3. Auth schemas (LoginRequest, RegisterRequest, UserResponse)
4. Special response schemas (BirthdayResponse with age calculation, etc.)

Follow the exact request/response formats specified in API-Schema.md.
```

### 3. Authentication System

```
Create server/app/auth.py implementing:

1. Password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
2. User registration function
3. Login verification function
4. get_current_user dependency for FastAPI
5. Session management helpers

Follow the security requirements in docs/Security-Privacy.md.
```

### 4. AI Stub Module

```
Create server/app/ai_stub.py with:

1. Static Bible verses for all 8 life areas (use content from docs/Prompts.md)
2. Static insights for all 8 life areas
3. generate_bible_verse(area: str) -> dict function
4. generate_insight(area: str) -> str function

These should return deterministic placeholders ready to be swapped with real AI later.
```

### 5. Main Application

```
Create server/app/main.py with:

1. FastAPI app initialization
2. CORS middleware configuration (allow localhost:3000 for future frontend)
3. Session middleware with secret from environment
4. Include all routers (when created)
5. Startup event to create tables
6. Root endpoint that returns API info

Use the architecture from docs/Architecture.md.
```

### 6. Goals Router

```
Using docs/API-Schema.md, implement server/app/routers/goals.py with:

- GET /goals - List with filters (area_id, timeframe, status)
- POST /goals - Create with area linking
- GET /goals/{id} - Retrieve single goal
- PUT /goals/{id} - Update including progress
- DELETE /goals/{id} - Delete

Include:
- Authentication requirement (get_current_user dependency)
- User data isolation (filter by user_id)
- Proper error handling (404 if not found, 401 if unauthorized)
- Many-to-many area linking via GoalAreaLink

Return responses matching the schemas in API-Schema.md exactly.
```

### 7. Habits Router

```
Implement server/app/routers/habits.py with CRUD plus special check-in endpoint:

- GET /habits - List with filters
- POST /habits - Create
- GET /habits/{id} - Retrieve
- PUT /habits/{id} - Update
- DELETE /habits/{id} - Delete
- POST /habits/{id}/checkin - Special endpoint that:
  * Accepts optional checkin_date (defaults to today)
  * Creates HabitCheckin record
  * Updates current_streak (increment if consecutive, reset if gap)
  * Updates longest_streak if current > longest
  * Prevents duplicate check-ins for same date
  * Returns updated habit with new streak

Use the streak calculation logic described in docs/Data-Model.md.
```

### 8. Contacts Router + Birthday Calculation

```
Implement server/app/routers/contacts.py including the special birthday endpoint:

Standard CRUD plus:
- GET /contacts/birthdays?days_ahead=30
  * Calculate exact age in years, months, days
  * Calculate days until next birthday
  * Filter to only contacts with birthdays in next X days
  * Sort by days_until_birthday

Use the age calculation helper from docs/Data-Model.md:
- Account for year, month, and day differences
- Handle edge cases (leap years, month-end dates)
```

### 9. All Other Routers

```
Implement the following routers following the same pattern as goals/habits:

1. server/app/routers/areas.py - Simple GET /areas returning 8 predefined areas
2. server/app/routers/tasks.py - CRUD with status transitions
3. server/app/routers/references.py - CRUD with type filtering
4. server/app/routers/health.py - CRUD with catalog_type filtering
5. server/app/routers/finance.py - CRUD with account_type filtering
6. server/app/routers/entries.py - CRUD with date range filtering
7. server/app/routers/one_on_one.py - CRUD with max 3 topics enforcement
8. server/app/routers/ai.py - GET endpoints returning stub content

Use docs/API-Schema.md for exact endpoint specifications.
```

### 10. Alembic Migrations

```
Set up Alembic migrations:

1. Initialize Alembic in server/ directory
2. Configure alembic.ini to use DATABASE_URL from .env
3. Configure migrations/env.py to:
   - Import all SQLModel models
   - Set target_metadata = SQLModel.metadata
4. Create initial migration: alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"
5. Review the generated migration file
6. Test with: alembic upgrade head

Also create server/seed_db.py script that:
- Loads seed/fixtures.json
- Creates the 8 life areas
- Optionally creates test user and sample data
```

### 11. Pytest Test Suite

```
Create test infrastructure:

1. server/tests/conftest.py with fixtures:
   - test_db (in-memory SQLite)
   - test_client (FastAPI TestClient)
   - test_user (authenticated user)

2. server/tests/test_auth.py:
   - Test user registration
   - Test login success/failure
   - Test logout
   - Test authentication required on protected endpoints

3. server/tests/test_habits.py:
   - Test habit check-in increments streak correctly
   - Test duplicate check-in prevention
   - Test streak reset after gap

4. server/tests/test_contacts.py:
   - Test birthday age calculation accuracy
   - Test upcoming birthdays filtering

Use the test scenarios from docs/Acceptance-Tests.md.
```

### 12. Infrastructure Files

```
Create deployment infrastructure:

1. Dockerfile:
   - FROM python:3.11-slim
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Copy server code
   - Run migrations on startup
   - CMD uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

2. Makefile with targets:
   - setup: Create venv, install deps, copy .env
   - migrate: Run alembic upgrade head
   - seed: Run seed script
   - run: Start uvicorn with --reload
   - test: Run pytest
   - clean: Remove __pycache__, .pyc files
   - docker-build: Build Docker image
   - docker-run: Run Docker container

Follow the examples in docs/Implementation-Plan.md Day 9.
```

## üîÑ Incremental Implementation Workflow

### Option A: Component by Component

```
Let's implement this step by step:

STEP 1: Set up the database foundation
- Create db.py with SQLite engine
- Create all models in models.py
- Test that tables can be created

STEP 2: Add schemas
- Create all Pydantic schemas in schemas.py

STEP 3: Add authentication
- Create auth.py
- Test password hashing and verification

STEP 4: Create main app
- Create main.py with basic setup
- Add one simple router to test

STEP 5: Build routers incrementally
- Start with areas.py (simplest)
- Then goals.py
- Then habits.py (most complex due to streaks)
- Continue with remaining routers

STEP 6: Add migrations and seeding
- Set up Alembic
- Create seed script

STEP 7: Add tests
- Start with auth tests
- Add router tests

STEP 8: Infrastructure
- Dockerfile
- Makefile

Let's start with STEP 1. Ready?
```

### Option B: Vertical Slice Approach

```
Let's implement one complete feature end-to-end, then iterate:

SLICE 1: User Authentication
- Models: User
- Schemas: UserCreate, UserResponse, LoginRequest
- Router: auth.py with register/login/logout
- Tests: test_auth.py
- Goal: Can register and login

SLICE 2: Goals Feature
- Models: Goal, GoalAreaLink, LifeArea
- Schemas: GoalCreate, GoalUpdate, GoalResponse
- Router: goals.py with full CRUD
- Tests: test_goals.py
- Goal: Can manage goals with authentication

SLICE 3: Habits with Streaks
- Models: Habit, HabitAreaLink, HabitCheckin
- Schemas: HabitCreate, HabitCheckin
- Router: habits.py with check-in logic
- Tests: test_habits.py (streak calculation)
- Goal: Can track habits and build streaks

[Continue with remaining features...]

Which slice should we start with?

The data model specification is in docs/Data-Model.md.

What could be wrong and how do I fix it?
```

### Authentication Issues

```
Authentication isn't working. The issue is: [DESCRIBE ISSUE]

My implementation:
- Using bcrypt for password hashing
- Session cookies with Starlette SessionMiddleware
- get_current_user dependency

Security requirements are in docs/Security-Privacy.md.

How should I fix this?
```

### Streak Calculation Issues

```
Habit streak calculation isn't working correctly.

Current behavior: [DESCRIBE CURRENT BEHAVIOR]
Expected behavior: [DESCRIBE EXPECTED]

The streak logic is described in docs/Data-Model.md section 4.1 and docs/Acceptance-Tests.md scenario 3.3-3.4.

Help me debug this.
